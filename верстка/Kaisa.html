        <div id="one" class="elem1">Claimed by Void Crest the Void when she was only a child, Kai'Sa managed to survive
            through sheer tenacity and strength of will. Her experiences have made her a deadly hunter and, to some, the
            harbinger of a future they would rather not live to see. Having entered into an uneasy symbiosis with a
            living Void carapace, the time will soon come when she must decide whether to forgive those mortals who
            would call her a monster, and defeat the coming darkness together... or simply to forget, as the Void
            consumes the world that left her behind.</div>
        <div id="two" class="elem2">Kai'Sa is a slender, pale-skinned woman with long dark brown hair. Her robes are
            composed of a Void Symbiote with a distinct palette of grey, dark grey, purple and bronze. The most
            distinctive ornaments of her attire are some purple marks on her face.</div>
