        <div id="one" class="elem1">t is unclear if Vel'Koz Vel'Koz was the first Voidborn to emerge on Runeterra, but there has certainly never been another to match his level of cruel, calculating sentience. While his kin devour or defile everything around them, he seeks instead to scrutinize and study the physical realm—and the strange, warlike beings that dwell there—for any weakness the Void Crest Void might exploit. But Vel'Koz is far from a passive observer, striking back at threats with deadly plasma, or by disrupting the very fabric of the world itself.</div>

            composed of a Void Symbiote with a distinct palette of grey, dark grey, purple and bronze. The most
            distinctive ornaments of her attire are some purple marks on her face.</div>
