        <div id="one" class="elem1">From the moment Cho'Gath first emerged into the harsh light of Runeterra's sun, the
            beast was driven by the most pure and insatiable hunger. A perfect expression of the Void's desire to
            consume all life, Cho'Gath's complex biology quickly converts matter into new bodily growth—increasing its
            muscle mass and density, or hardening its outer carapace like organic diamond. When growing larger does not
            suit the Void-spawn's needs, it vomits out the excess material as razor-sharp spines razor-sharp spines,
            leaving prey skewered and ready to feast feast upon later.</div>
