        <div id="two" class="elem2">To be a mortal touched by this power is to suffer an agonizing glimpse of eternal
            unreality, enough to shatter even the strongest mind. Denizens of the Void realm itself are
            construct-creatures, often of only limited sentience, but tasked with a singular purpose - to usher in total
            oblivion across Runeterra.<br><br>Screaming into existence with the birth of the universe, the Void is a
            manifestation of the unknowable nothingness that lies beyond. It is a force of insatiable hunger, waiting
            through the eons until its masters, the mysterious Watchers, mark the final time of undoing, and so usher in
            total oblivion across Runeterra. <br><br>The Watchers originated from the Void, a vast canvas of
            nothingness, in which the concept of its existence is a mystery, even to themselves. From the time the
            bravest among them first entered Runeterra, the Watchers did not possess material form, nor were they even
            aware of their own sentience. The Watchers did not know why they or the Void existed, only that it perturbed
            them that something, that something being our universe, existed in the vast blackness of nothing. In their
            curious and spiteful intent of understanding the material universe, they reshaped matter within it into
            conscious extensions of themselves tasked to collect information and knowledge in their behalf, becoming the
            prototype of the current and modern Voidborn.</bre>
